Developer-Feedback-for-Government-APIs
======================================

A pilot project for accepting public feedback on US Government APIs.  


### Have ideas or feedback for a government API?  

* [File an issue here](https://github.com/GSA/Developer-Feedback-for-Government-APIs/issues).
* Be sure to tag your issue with the agency you're trying to give feedback to.  


### Want developer feedback for your APIs?  

List your agency below and the community can promise you a speedy response. 

* General Services Administration
* U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian
* Federal Emergency Management Agency


### Project To Do
* Is there a limit on the number of labels one can have in GitHub?  
* Is there a way to create a widget for the issues that have a certain label?  E.g., so an agency could apply
* Start a running best practices list that builds from this feedback, like [this](https://github.com/GSA/slash-developer-pages/blob/master/API_Checklist.md) but better?
* Create some sort of chart that can serve as scoreboard for agencies (by label, number of issues/open/closed)
